code challenge for Kinetic Supply

=======
on routes.php
- used both direct post and controller where warranted... sometimes it is not necessary and I hope it is shown I know the difference.

on database
- I created 2 tables.  The challenge called for 1, but with an relational database it is easier to show knowledge of FK with 2, also it shows that I know how to use a relational database.

on commenting
- the BooksController file is commented with what each function does

on layout
- the template uses bootstrap and jquery, along with jquery.datatables for formatting of the output, it is a responsive design (though simplistic) and the menu will create an active class on the active pages only

on delete
- normally, I would change a state from active to inactive (0,1 toggle) in the database instead of deleting a record, but you requested the ability to delete.  Also, I would normally use a jquery modal to ask confirmation of delete before performing the action

on laravel
- Thank you.  That is all I can say.  For motivating me to get more into the framework and using it.  It is amazing on how it improves the experience of development
